## CheckiO Challenges Python
My path to conquer CheckiO Python challenges starting 2022. 
py.CheckiO is online Python practices. Improve your coding skills by solving coding challenges and exercises online with your friends in a fun way. 
* [INITIATION](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/tree/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION)
  * [1 Multiply (Intro)](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION/1%20Multiply%20(Intro).py)-Into mission. How to solve missions on CheckiO?
  * [2 First Word](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION/2%20First%20Word.py)-Find the first word in a string.
  * [3 Acceptable Password I](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION/3%20Acceptable%20Password%20I.py)-the length should be bigger than 6.
  * [4 Number Length](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION/4%20Number%20Length.py)-How many digits are in the given positive number?
  * [5 The Most Frequent](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION/5%20The%20Most%20Frequent.py)-Determine the most frequently occurring string in the sequence.
  * [6 End Zeros](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/CheckiO%20Challenges%20Python/INITIATION/6%20End%20Zeros.py)-How many zeros are at the end?
## Data Science
Libraries for Data Science.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)-The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)-A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
* [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html)-a built-in Python library for descriptive statistics.
## Development Tools
The modules described in this chapter help you write software.
* [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)-Provides runtime support for type hints.
## Fun Projects
* [Drawing](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/tree/main/Fun%20Projects/Drawing)
  * [Mickey](https://github.com/EvansHua/Python_Corner/blob/main/Fun%20Projects/Drawing/Mickey/Mickey.py) - Drawing Mickey via Turtle. My VERY FIRST Python project developed in Grade 3! Have fun!
